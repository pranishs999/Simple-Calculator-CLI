# Simple Calculator

A simple calculator program built using Python. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes user input to perform calculations and displays the results.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, with a check for division by zero.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid input (non-numeric) and division by zero errors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed.

## How It Works

The program offers a simple command-line interface. The user is prompted to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), and then to enter two numbers. The result of the selected operation is displayed. The user can continue performing calculations or exit the program.

### Operations:

1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide

## Running the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ``` bash 
   python3 calculator.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the calculator.

## Example Usage
## Start the Program

    Welcome to the Simple Calculator!
    Select operation:
    1. Add
    2. Subtract
    3. Multiply
    4. Divide
    Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
    Enter first number: 10
    Enter second number: 5
    10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
    Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): yes

## Invalid Input
    Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.
    Enter first number: abc
    Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.

## Division by Zero
    Enter first number: 10
    Enter second number: 0
    10.0 / 0.0 = Error! Division by zero.

## Exit the Program

    Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no
    Exiting the calculator............
    Goodbye! Thanks for using the calculator.

## Future Enhancements
-**Extended Functionality**: Adding more advanced operations such as exponentiation, modulus, or square roots.

-**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A GUI using Tkinter or another framework for a more user-friendly interface.
